FLAPPY BIRD WITH HAND GESTURES
A Python-based implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game where the player controls the bird's movement using hand gestures detected through a webcam.
Installation required:  Python, Pygame, OpenCV
Difference from classic Flappy Bird: The only movement in the game, i.e., Up using space bar or up button is replaced with the hand gesture. Clicking with index finger and thumb will do the action required to proceed the game.
A special feature also added to make the experience fully handsfree is closing of game with hand gesture. Taking your index finger tip to the upper most part will make the game close. Also it should be taken in consideration that while playing, your index finger should be in centre or below it to avoid the unnecessary closing of game midway.
Future scope: Tracking with face movement or eye movement.
